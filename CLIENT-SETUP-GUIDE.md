# 🎯 Zero-Setup Workflow Distribution

## For Your Clients: **NO SETUP REQUIRED!**

### What Happens When Client Installs Your App:

1. **Client downloads your app** (.exe/.msi installer)
2. **Client runs the app** → Electron starts
3. **Client clicks "Start n8n"** → n8n starts with your workflows already installed
4. **Client clicks "Open n8n Editor"** → Sees fully configured GSTR2B workflows
5. **Client clicks "Process GSTR2B"** → Workflows run immediately

## 🔄 **Automatic Installation Process**

### Step 1: Your Development
```
You create workflows in n8n → Export as JSON → Place in resources/n8n-templates/
```

### Step 2: App Distribution  
```
Electron bundles your templates → Ships with ready-made workflows
```

### Step 3: Client First Run
```
App detects first launch → Copies your workflows → Creates .workflows-installed marker
```

### Step 4: Client Ready to Use
```
n8n starts → Workflows already available → Zero configuration needed
```

## 📦 **What Your Clients Get Out-of-the-Box**
