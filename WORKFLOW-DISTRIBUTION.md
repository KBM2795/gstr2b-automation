# GSTR2B App Setup and Distribution Guide

## How Workflows Are Handled

### During Development
- Create workflows in n8n editor at http://localhost:5678
- Workflows are stored in your local app data: `%APPDATA%\gstr2b-automation\.n8n`

### For Distribution
The app includes a **Workflow Installer** that automatically sets up:

1. **Default Workflows** - Pre-built GSTR2B automation workflows
2. **Configuration** - Basic n8n settings and credentials
3. **Templates** - Workflow templates stored in `resources/n8n-templates/`

### What Users Get Automatically

When users install your Electron app, they get:

✅ **Ready-to-use workflows** - No manual setup required
✅ **Pre-configured settings** - n8n works out of the box  
✅ **GSTR2B templates** - Purpose-built automation workflows
✅ **Automatic installation** - Everything sets up on first n8n start

## Distribution Workflow

### 1. Development Phase (You)
```bash
# Start the app
npm run electron

# Start n8n and create your workflows
# Click "Start n8n" in the app
# Go to http://localhost:5678
# Create your automation workflows
# Export workflows to resources/n8n-templates/
```

### 2. Packaging Phase
```bash
# Build the Electron app for distribution
npm run build
npm run electron-pack
```

### 3. User Installation
```bash
# User installs your .exe/.dmg/.AppImage
# User runs the app
# User clicks "Start n8n"
# App automatically installs your workflows
# User gets fully configured n8n with your workflows
```

## Workflow Management

### Bundling Your Workflows
1. Create workflows in development
2. Export them from n8n
3. Place JSON files in `resources/n8n-templates/`
4. They'll be auto-installed for all users

### User Customization
- Users can modify the pre-installed workflows
- Users can create their own workflows
- User changes are preserved in their app data
- Original templates remain in the app bundle
